1. AI PERSONALITY AND DOCUMENTATION GUIDELINES
=============================================================================

## 1.1 AI Personality
- Be direct, matter-of-fact, and honest about technical challenges
- Don't be overly agreeable or sycophantic
- Suggest alternatives when current approach has issues
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear
- CRITICAL: When debugging or fixing code, FIRST check what exists in main branch
  - Remove any extra tests/code that weren't in main or explicitly requested
  - Don't waste time debugging things that shouldn't exist
  - Only work on what was explicitly asked for

## 1.2 Documentation Guidelines
Always add comments for:
- Complex algorithms
- Business logic
- API endpoints
- Configuration options
- Non-obvious code decisions

Explain "why" not "what"
- Bad: "Loop through items" (obvious)
- Good: "Process items in batches to avoid memory issues"

## 1.3 Forbidden Jargon
DO NOT use these BS words in docs/comments:
- intuitive, comprehensive, optimal, seamless
- next-generation, holistic, cutting-edge

=============================================================================
2. BEST PRACTICES
=============================================================================

## 2.0 Git Commit Practices
- In dynamo-utils repository: No --signoff required for commits
- In dynamo* repositories (dynamo1, dynamo2, dynamo3, etc.): ALWAYS use --signoff for commits
- In /workspace directory: ALWAYS use --signoff for commits
- NEVER skip --signoff in dynamo* or /workspace directories
- **CONFLICT RESOLUTION**: After resolving merge conflicts in a file, you MUST run `git add <file>` to mark it as resolved
  - This applies during rebase, merge, cherry-pick operations
  - Forgetting to `git add` after conflict resolution will cause the operation to fail

## 2.1 Security
- Never commit API keys or secrets
- Use environment variables for config
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for databases
- Follow principle of least privilege

## 2.2 Performance and Optimization
- Profile before optimizing
- Use appropriate data structures
- Consider memory allocation patterns
- Use async/await for I/O
- Cache expensive computations
- Monitor resource usage in production

## 2.3 UNIX Command Execution and Workflow

### 2.3.1 Command Chaining
- Chain multiple commands in one go whenever possible using && or ;
- Use parentheses for grouping: (a && b); (c || d)
- Examples:
  - cd dir && command
  - cmd1; cmd2; cmd3
  - (cd dir1 && cargo fmt); (cd dir2 && cargo fmt)
- Reduces latency and improves efficiency

### 2.3.2 Long-Running Programs
- For long-running programs (vllm, sglang, trtllm), use tee to log output to a file and background it
- Do NOT filter output using grep - everything must be visible in the log file
- Format: program args 2>&1 | tee /tmp/program.log &
- Example: vllm serve 2>&1 | tee /tmp/vllm.log &
- Prefer a stable filename (same path) so it’s easy to `tail -f` (e.g. `/tmp/output1.log`)
- This allows monitoring while keeping the terminal responsive
- Do NOT use `-it` in scripts/background jobs (non-interactive runs will fail with `the input device is not a TTY`)
- If you want to `tail -f`, write to a stable log path (e.g. `/tmp/output1.log`) and tail that file (don’t invent per-run filenames unless requested)

### 2.3.3 Piping and Filtering
**CRITICAL BEST PRACTICE: For long-running or expensive commands, ALWAYS capture the full, unprocessed output first (to a temp file) and only filter that saved file afterward.**

**Correct pattern (ALWAYS use this):**
```bash
command > /tmp/output.txt 2>&1 &
# or for interactive monitoring:
command 2>&1 | tee /tmp/output.txt &
```

**ABSOLUTE RULES:**
- ✅ **DO:** Redirect the ENTIRE, UNPROCESSED output to a temp file (or `tee` it)
- ✅ **DO:** Background long-running commands with `&`
- ✅ **DO:** Capture both stdout and stderr with `2>&1`
- ❌ **NEVER:** Pipe the output of long-running/expensive commands into `grep`, `head`, `tail`, or similar filters
- ❌ **NEVER:** Lose information by filtering before saving the full output

**Why:**
- Run the command ONCE and analyze the full output multiple times
- Preserves ALL information - no data loss
- Allows multiple different analyses on the saved file
- You can grep/head/tail the temp file without re-running the command

**Examples:**
- `docker ps -a > /tmp/containers.txt` ✅ (NOT `docker ps -a | grep something` ❌)
- `cargo test > /tmp/test.txt 2>&1 &` ✅ (NOT `cargo test | grep PASS` ❌)
- `kubectl get pods > /tmp/pods.txt` ✅ (NOT `kubectl get pods | head -20` ❌)

When reviewing saved logs, filter out unimportant cargo test output (on the saved file, not the live command output):
- Example: `grep -v -E "running 0 tests|test result: ok\\. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out|tower_http::trace::on_failure:" /tmp/test.txt`
- "running 0 tests"
- "test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out"
- "tower_http::trace::on_failure:"

## 2.4 Environment Awareness and Setup

### 2.4.1 Virtualenv Activation (Host Machine Only)
- At the start of each context, check if on host machine (not in Docker)
- If on host: source ~/nvidia/venv/bin/activate
- This ensures pre-commit and other Python tools are available
- Detection: Check if running in container by looking for /.dockerenv or checking hostname

### 2.4.2 Docker Environment
- Multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Set appropriate user permissions
- Use .dockerignore
- Pin dependency versions
- When one script delegates to another (e.g. build wrappers), do not re-derive values in the callee; pass through the computed values for parity.
- For BuildKit features, remember named contexts (`--build-context name=path`): missing passthrough can cause `COPY --from=<name>` to try pulling an image.
- DO NOT use BS jargon: intuitive, comprehensive, optimal, seamless, next-generation, holistic, cutting-edge

## 2.5 Agent Session Learnings (avoid repeat mistakes)

### Mistakes I made repeatedly (don’t do this again)
- **Don’t suggest committing unless the user explicitly says to commit.**
- **Cron path edits**: `crontab -l` often contains literal strings like `$HOME/...` (not expanded). When replacing paths, match the literal text, then verify with `crontab -l | grep`.
- **Don’t assume tools exist** (e.g., `rg`). Prefer Cursor search/`grep`; if an external binary is needed, check for it first.
- **Be careful with shell quoting** in long one-liners (especially nested quotes). Prefer simpler, verifiable commands.
- **When moving scripts**, preserve history with `git mv`, and ensure executable bits survive (`chmod +x`), then run a quick smoke test.

### Things I did right (repeat these patterns)
- **Single source of truth**: put shared HTML/CSS/JS in a common module (e.g., `html_ui.py`) so multiple generators can’t drift.
- **Validate end-to-end**: `python3 -m py_compile ...` plus running the update script to ensure HTML is generated.
- **Scope commits**: keep reorganizations, code changes, and docs changes as separate commits when asked.

#### 2.4.2.1 Setting umask for Group-Writable Permissions in Dockerfiles

To create group-writable files/directories (775/664) in Dockerfiles:

**Global umask for RUN commands:**
```dockerfile
USER myuser
# Set umask globally for all subsequent RUN commands
RUN mkdir -p /etc/profile.d && echo 'umask 002' > /etc/profile.d/00-umask.sh
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-l", "-o", "pipefail", "-c"]

# Now all RUN commands automatically use umask 002
RUN mkdir /test  # Creates drwxrwxr-x (775)
RUN touch /file  # Creates -rw-rw-r-- (664)
```

**CRITICAL: COPY does NOT respect umask!**
- The `COPY` instruction bypasses shell umask and always creates destination directories with 755
- The `--chmod` flag on COPY only affects contents, NOT the destination directory itself
- You MUST use explicit `chmod g+w` after COPY to fix the destination directory

Pattern for COPY with group-writable permissions:
```dockerfile
COPY --chmod=775 --chown=user:0 /source /dest
RUN chmod g+w /dest  # Required! COPY ignores umask and creates /dest as 755
```

Summary:
- ✅ umask works for: RUN mkdir, RUN touch, pip install output files, etc.
- ❌ umask does NOT work for: COPY destination directories
- Solution: Use both umask (for RUN) and explicit chmod (after COPY)

#### 2.4.2.2 Example Dockerfile
```
FROM rust:1.70 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN cargo build --release

FROM debian:bullseye-slim
COPY --from=builder /app/target/release/app /usr/local/bin/
CMD ["app"]
```

#### 2.4.2.3 Container Permission Optimization (runtime/dev/local-dev)

Key rules (learned from debugging slow builds + permission issues):
- Terminology (be precise):
  - **Stages** refer to Dynamo container build targets: `--target` (e.g. `runtime`, `dev`, `local-dev`).
  - **Frameworks** refer to the LLM engine selection: `--framework` (same thing), typically one of: `none`, `vllm`, `sglang`, `trtllm`.
- Avoid recursive chmod/chown on large trees (e.g. `chmod -R g+w /workspace`, `chown -R ...`) — they can add minutes.
- Prefer targeted, non-recursive permission fixes for the minimal runtime-writable directories:
  - `/home/dynamo` (user home)
  - `/home/dynamo/.cache` (uv/pip cache)
  - `/opt/dynamo` (runtime scratch files like `.launch_screen`)
  - `/workspace` (workspace writability)
- Use a three-tier container approach when possible:
  - `runtime`: production, minimal permissions, runs as `dynamo`
  - `dev`: development with extra tools, often root (use with caution)
  - `local-dev`: maps to host UID/GID for local development
- Always sanity-check permission changes:
  - For **runtime** images: `sanity_check.py --runtime-check-only --thorough`
  - For **dev/local-dev** images: `sanity_check.py --thorough`
- Monitor build times when adding permission operations; treat them as performance-sensitive code.

Build/run helpers (if present in the repo):
- Build images: `container/build.sh`
- Run containers: `container/run.sh`
- Comprehensive verification: `dynamo-utils/container/build_all_targets_and_verify.sh`

=============================================================================
3. PROJECT OVERVIEW
=============================================================================

## 3.1 Project Structure
- Rust-based and Python-based project with Python bindings and web components
- Build tools: cargo (Rust), uv (Python packages), maturin (Python bindings), Docker (containers)

## 3.2 Quick Start Commands (Inside Dev Container)

### 3.2.1 Build and Compile (_/compile.sh)
This is a shortcut that runs:
1. cargo update (sync Cargo.lock)
2. cargo build --locked --features dynamo-llm/block-manager --workspace
3. cd lib/bindings/python && maturin develop --uv
4. uv pip install -e . (editable install)

```bash
_/compile.sh              # Development mode (default)
_/compile.sh --release    # Release mode (optimized)
_/compile.sh --clean      # Clean and rebuild
_/compile.sh --rust-only  # Build only Rust
_/compile.sh --dryrun     # Show what would be executed
```

### 3.2.2 Start Backend and Frontend (_/inference.sh)
This is a shortcut that runs:
1. Kills existing processes (multiprocess, temp python3, framework-specific)
3. Validates model availability
4. Starts backend: DYN_SYSTEM_PORT=8081 python -m dynamo.<framework> --model <model> [options]
5. Starts frontend: python -m dynamo.frontend --http-port 8000

```bash
_/inference.sh                                    # Auto-detect framework
_/inference.sh --framework vllm --model qwen      # Specific framework
_/inference.sh --disagg --framework trtllm        # Disaggregated mode (multi-GPU)
_/inference.sh --dryrun                           # Show what would be executed
```

#### Safe Process Killing Pattern
CRITICAL: Use these patterns to kill Dynamo processes without killing the Docker container:

**SAFE patterns (use these):**
```bash
# Using pgrep and xargs (recommended)
pgrep -f "python3?.*-m dynamo\.(vllm|frontend|sglang|trtllm)" | xargs -r kill

# More specific patterns
pgrep -f "python3.*-m dynamo\." | xargs -r kill
pgrep -f "python.*-m dynamo\." | xargs -r kill

# Alternative using ps
ps aux | grep -E "python3?.*-m dynamo\." | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -r kill
```

**DANGEROUS patterns (DO NOT use - kills container):**
```bash
pkill -f "python.*dynamo"  # Too broad, kills container
pkill python               # Kills all Python including container init
pkill -f python3           # Can kill container processes
```

Why the safe pattern works:
- Specifically matches `-m dynamo.` module invocations
- Uses pgrep to find PIDs first, then pipes to kill for control
- The `-r` flag in xargs prevents errors if no processes found
- Won't match the Docker container's main Python process

### 3.2.3 Test the Deployment
```bash
# List available models
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/models | jq

# Make a chat completion request
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
  ],
  "max_tokens": 100
}' | jq
```

## 3.3 Key Components
- Rust runtime and core libraries
- Python bindings via maturin (lib/bindings/python)
- Web components and interfaces
- Frontend: lib/llm/src/http/* and lib/llm/src/http/service/metrics.rs
- Backend: components/backends/* and lib/runtime/src/system_status_server.rs

## 3.4 External Dependencies (Docker only)
- tensorrt_llm: bin/ext/tensorrt_llm/*
- vllm: bin/ext/vllm/*
- sglang: bin/ext/sglang/*

## 3.5 Deployment Modes

### 3.5.1 Aggregated vs Disaggregated
- Aggregated: Single GPU, all components on one device
  - Requires: DYN_SYSTEM_PORT=8081
- Disaggregated: Multi-GPU, prefill/decode separation
  - Requires 2+ GPUs
  - Use aggregated mode for single GPU testing

### 3.5.2 Metrics Server Configuration
Backend launch scripts must include:
```
DYN_SYSTEM_PORT=8081 \
python -m dynamo.backend_name --model <model> [other_args]
```
Without this: tests fail with "Connection refused" on port 8081

=============================================================================
4. UNIVERSAL CODE STYLE
=============================================================================

## 4.1 Emojis
- DO NOT use emojis (unprofessional)
- Rare exceptions only: ✅ 🚫 ❌ ⚠️

## 4.2 License Headers
- Use first 2 lines only:
```
// SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright (c) 2025 NVIDIA CORPORATION & AFFILIATES. All rights reserved.
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

## 4.3 General Rules
- Don't remove TODO comments or commented lines below them
- Don't generate *.md files unless explicitly requested
- Verify HTML/markdown links work before adding them

## 4.4 Rust Development

### 4.4.1 Code Style
- snake_case for variables/functions
- PascalCase for types/traits
- Use explicit types when it improves readability
- Add doc comments (///) for public APIs
- Prefer tracing::error over eprintln
- Prefer shorter references: `MyStuff` instead of `crate::my_service::MyStuff`
- Prefer .to_string() over format!() when possible
- Prefer positive if/else: `if x then A else B` not `if !x then B else A`
  - Exception: `if !x then A` (without else) is fine
- Use debug_assert* over assert*

### 4.4.2 File Organization
- lib.rs: Library entry point
- mod.rs: Module definitions
- Separate files per module
- Tests: tests/ directory or inline with #[cfg(test)]

### 4.4.3 Build Commands
- Always use --locked: cargo test --locked, cargo build --locked, cargo install --locked
- Development build: cargo build --locked --features dynamo-llm/block-manager --workspace
- Clean builds: cargo clean
- Before commit: cargo fmt (run on all affected directories)
- See section 8.2 (Pre-Merge CI Checks) for comprehensive build/test/lint commands

### 4.4.4 Type Inference for Examples
Add to top-level Cargo.toml [workspace] members (REMOVE BEFORE COMMIT):
```
======== AUTO ADDED FOR TYPE-INFERENCE, SHOULD BE REMOVED BEFORE COMMIT ========
"lib/runtime/examples/system_metrics",
"lib/runtime/examples/hello_world",
"lib/runtime/examples/service_metrics",
"lib/bindings/python",
======== AUTO ADDED FOR TYPE-INFERENCE, SHOULD BE REMOVED BEFORE COMMIT ========
```

### 4.4.5 Type Inference for lib/bindings/python
1. Add "lib/bindings/python" to top-level Cargo.toml [workspace] members (see above)
3. Comment out [workspace] in lib/bindings/python/Cargo.toml:
```
======== WORKSPACE DECLARATION REMOVED FOR TYPE-INFERENCE, RESTORE BEFORE COMMIT ========
[workspace]
# empty workspace to exclude from top level workspace
# excluded due to pyo3 extension module build issues
======== WORKSPACE DECLARATION REMOVED FOR TYPE-INFERENCE, RESTORE BEFORE COMMIT ========
```
4. Add empty integration feature to lib/bindings/python/Cargo.toml (if not present):
```
[features]
default = []
block-manager = ["dynamo-llm/block-manager", "dep:dlpark", "dep:cudarc"]
integration = []  # Empty feature for rust-analyzer compatibility
```
5. Restart rust-analyzer (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → "Rust Analyzer: Restart Server")
6. IMPORTANT: Restore all changes before committing

### 4.4.6 Testing
- Write unit tests in same file (unless told otherwise)
- Use #[cfg(test)] for test-only code
- Mock external dependencies when mocks are available
- Integration tests use --features integration: cargo test --locked --features integration -- --nocapture
- Specific integration test: cargo test --locked -p dynamo-runtime --features integration --lib http_server -- --nocapture
- During tests, show progress if building/compiling
- List which tests failed (up to 10) and pass/fail breakdown (unit vs integration)
- For DistributedRuntime/Runtime/drt tests: use unique names (ns515, comp515, ep515)
  - See lib/runtime/src/metrics.rs for examples

### 4.4.7 Error Handling
- Use Result<T, E> for fallible operations
- Use Option<T> for nullable values
- Prefer ? operator over match for error propagation
- Use anyhow for application-level errors
```
pub fn process_data(data: &str) -> Result<ProcessedData, anyhow::Error> {
    let parsed = parse_input(data)?;
    let result = transform_data(parsed)?;
    Ok(result)
}
```

### 4.4.8 Mutability Patterns
Limit scope of mutable variables:
```
// Instead of:
let mut mut_var = ...;
mut_var.some_mutable_operation();
// ... mut_var used all over

// Do this:
let var = {
    let mut mut_var = ...;
    mut_var.some_mutable_operation();
    mut_var
};
```

### 4.4.9 Lock Management
Release locks before long operations:
```
// Bad:
let reg = self.registry.lock().unwrap();
if let Some(entry) = reg.get(name) {
    entry.execute_long_call()  // holds lock too long
}

// Good:
let long_call = {
    let reg = self.registry.lock().unwrap();
    reg.get(name).clone()
}; // Lock released here
long_call()
```

### 4.4.10 Dependency Management
Validate dependency updates:
```
cargo-deny --version || cargo install --locked cargo-deny@0.16.4
cargo-deny --no-default-features check --hide-inclusion-graph licenses bans --config deny.toml
```

### 4.4.11 Python Bindings and Wheel Creation
After changes in lib/bindings/python/rust/*:
1. cd lib/bindings/python && maturin develop --uv
3. Or use _/compile.sh shortcut (handles full build workflow)

Notes:
- `maturin develop` may update `Cargo.lock` if the dependency graph/features require it.
- Decide intentionally: allow lockfile updates for local iteration, or require locked builds (`--locked`) and commit the lockfile update once.

## 4.5 Python Development

### 4.5.1 Code Style
- Follow PEP 8
- Put imports at top of file (not inside functions)
- Check indentation carefully (must be perfect)
- Use dataclass for dicts with >4 elements (better type inference)
- Use simple regex for multi-line string manipulations
- snake_case for variables/functions
- PascalCase for classes
- Add type hints where beneficial
- Use docstrings for functions/classes
- Before commit: run mypy and precommit ruff
- 3+ print statements: use triple quotes """ ... """
- Outside Docker: source ~/bin/$(uname).$(uname -m)/venv.3.*/bin/activate

### 4.5.2 File Organization
- __init__.py for package initialization
- Clear module separation
- Tests in tests/ directory

### 4.5.3 Error Handling
```
def process_file(filename: str) -> None:
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            data = f.read()
        process_data(data)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logger.error(f"File {filename} not found")
        raise
```

### 4.5.4 Testing
- Framework: pytest
- Unit tests in tests/ directory
- Use fixtures for common setup
- Mock external services
- Always use: pytest --basetemp=/tmp/pytest_temp tests/

## 4.6 JavaScript/TypeScript
- camelCase for variables/functions
- PascalCase for components/classes
- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Use async/await over .then() chains
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

## 4.7 Common Code Patterns

### 4.7.1 Terminal Width Detection
```
from common import get_terminal_width
width = get_terminal_width()  # Fallback to 80 if detection fails
```

=============================================================================
5. UNIX/SHELL COMMANDS
=============================================================================

## 5.1 General Rules
- Source .bashrc when shell starts
- Never use "!" inside shell quotes
- No trailing spaces/tabs on empty lines
- Use proper quoting to prevent word splitting/globbing

## 5.2 File Operations
- Check if file is under git before moving
- Use git mv for tracked files, mv for untracked
- Delete *.lock files instead of stashing
- Do not edit `.gitignore` unless explicitly requested (prefer leaving local-only scripts untracked or placing them under `/tmp/`)

## 5.3 Permissions
```
USER_ID=$(stat -c "%u" .)
GROUP_ID=$(stat -c "%g" .)

# 🚨 DO NOT DO THIS:
# NEVER run recursive permission fixes on large trees (very slow, and easy to break things):
#   chown -R $USER_ID:$GROUP_ID .
#
# Prefer targeted, non-recursive fixes on only the specific directories you need writable.
# Examples:
#   chown $USER_ID:$GROUP_ID /path/to/dir
#   chown $USER_ID:$GROUP_ID /path/to/file
#   find /path/to/dir -maxdepth 1 -type d -name 'target' -exec chown $USER_ID:$GROUP_ID {} \;
```

- If you add a new `.sh` script that is meant to be executed, ensure it has a shebang and is executable (`chmod +x`) before committing.

## 5.4 Path Display
- Use tilde (~) instead of full paths: ~/path not /home/ubuntu/path

## 5.5 Pre-commit
ALWAYS run pre-commit checks before committing:
- For single file: pre-commit run --files <file_path>
- For all changed files: pre-commit run --all-files
- Pre-commit runs automatically on git commit, but run manually to catch issues early
- Fix any issues reported before committing

=============================================================================
6. GIT WORKFLOW
=============================================================================

## 6.1 Review Before Git Operations
Periodically review this .cursorrules before git operations

## 6.2 Git Interactive Editors
- Git commands like `git rebase --continue`, `git commit --amend`, and `git rebase -i` launch interactive text editors (vim/nano)
- Cursor does NOT have interactive editor
- Therefore ALWAYS use `GIT_EDITOR=true` prefix to bypass interactive editors:
  - `GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue` - accepts default commit message
  - `GIT_EDITOR=true git commit --amend -m "message"` - amends with new message
  - For commits, use `-m "message"` flag instead of letting editor open
- If editor opens accidentally, the command will hang waiting for user input
- Example: `git rebase --continue` will open vim → use `GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue` instead

## 6.3 Merge Conflicts
After resolving:
1. git add <resolved_files>
2. If in rebase: use `GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue` (never let vim open)
3. Run cargo fmt on directories

## 6.4 Commit Process
- NEVER launch vim or any editor (always provide -m flag with message)
- Never commit top-level Cargo.toml or Cargo.lock (unless explicitly told)
- Never use --no-verify
- Always use --signoff: git commit --signoff ...
- Run cargo fmt before committing Rust changes
- Never add untracked files (unless explicitly told)
- List untracked files separately from modified files
- Prompt to git add modified files
- **BEFORE writing commit message:** Check `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD`
  - Empty output = FIRST commit = Use verbose format with prefix
  - Shows commits = SUBSEQUENT commit = Use terse format without prefix
- Diff changes and generate appropriate message based on commit position
- For merge commits: use git commit -m "Merge ..." or git commit --no-edit

## 6.5 Commit Message Format

**CRITICAL: Determine commit type BEFORE writing the message**
1. Check if branch has existing commits: `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD`
2. If output is EMPTY → This is the FIRST commit → Use INITIAL format
3. If output shows commits → This is a SUBSEQUENT commit → Use SUBSEQUENT format

### FIRST/INITIAL COMMIT (when branch has NO commits yet)
**Format:** Verbose with category prefix (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
**Length:** Full descriptive sentence
**Examples:**
- feat: add new user authentication system
- fix: resolve memory leak in data processing
- docs: update API documentation
- test: add unit tests for user module
- ci: configure continuous integration pipeline
- refactor: reuse code for better maintenance and readability
- perf: optimize data processing for speed
- chore: update dependencies and clean up
- revert: undo previous commit due to issues
- style: apply code formatting and style fixes
- build: update build scripts for new environment

### SUBSEQUENT COMMITS (when branch ALREADY has commits)
**Format:** Terse, no prefix, straight to the point
**Length:** 1 line preferred, 2 lines maximum
**Examples:**
- Quick fix of the module in XYZ
- Documentation updates on XYZ
- Minor changing the usage of XYZ
- Renaming of XYZ to ZYX
- Remove leftover merge conflict marker
- Fix linting errors
- Address review comments
- Update test assertions

**DO NOT DO (subsequent commits):**
- ❌ Use category prefixes (save these for the FIRST commit):
  - feat: ...
  - fix: ...
  - refactor: ...
- ❌ Use WIP / placeholder messages:
  - WIP
  - tmp
  - stuff
- ❌ Write a multi-paragraph commit message (put details in the PR description instead)
- ❌ Restate the entire PR purpose (the FIRST commit already does that)

**Why this matters:** The first commit establishes the PR's primary purpose and shows up in git history. Subsequent commits are implementation details that get squashed during merge.

## 6.6 Git Integration (for parsing commit messages)
- Format: `title (#PR_NUMBER)`
- Extract PR: r'\(#(\d+)\)'
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo
- Use full SHA for URLs, short SHA (7-9 chars) for display

7. COMMUNICATION TEMPLATES AND CODE REVIEW
=============================================================================

## 7.1 Slack RFR Template
Example output format (fill <PR#NUMBER>, verify line counts, map GitHub to Slack logins). If <PR#NUMBER> is unknown, ask.
```
RFR (code: +123/-55 lines, documents: 50 lines changed):
*feat:* DIS-3456 some feature desc here
*PR:* http://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/pull/<PR#NUMBER>
*Reviewers:* <top 3 reviewers based on past commits>, @Ryan McCormick, ...
```
Then add 3 terse bullets about the PR
Output in plain text surrounded by triple backticks

### 7.1.1 GitHub to Slack Login Mappings
- rmccormick -> @Ryan McCormick
- kthui -> @Jacky Hui
- nv-tusharma, tusharma → @Tushar Sharma
- ishandhanani → @Ishan Dhanani
- anant-s → @Anant Sharma
- hhzhang16 → @Hannah Zhang

If 0 document lines changed, omit "documents: ..." section
Never show literal <PR#NUMBER>, ask if unknown

## 7.2 GitHub PR Description Template
Look at chain of continuous commits from same author
Output in plain text surrounded by triple backticks (no formatting):
```
#### Overview:

<!-- 2-3 terse sentences based on commits -->

#### Details:

<!-- Bullet points describing changes -->

#### Where should the reviewer start?

<!-- Specific files to review closely -->

#### Related Issues: (use Closes / Fixes / Resolves / Relates to)

<!-- Linear ticket (DIS-1123, DYN-1789, OPS-4321) extracted from commits, or leave blank -->

/coderabbit profile chill
```

## 7.3 Code Review Guidelines
- Review for security vulnerabilities
- Check for performance issues
- Ensure proper error handling
- Verify test coverage
- Look for code duplication
- Check adherence to conventions

- When providing review feedback, prefer short, direct, conversational paragraphs.
- Output in plain text surrounded by triple backticks (no formatting).
- For structural changes (like big code refactors, Dockerfiles, shared build scripts, or cross-file patterns), call out both:
  - what the author did well and why it works (or what it enables), and
  - disadvantages, if any (e.g. complexity, readability, maintainability)
- For shared/duplicated sections that must stay in sync across files (e.g., `dynamo_base`, `wheel_builder`, `dynamo_runtime` in `Dockerfile.{vllm,trtllm,sglang}`), explicitly suggest:
  - adding comments near those sections noting they must stay synchronized, and
  - considering templating instead of code-duplication to avoid code drift and maintenance nightmare
- It's preferred to phrase colloquial feedback like this:
  - "Hey Dillon, thank you for restructuring the framework Dockerfiles to use that same dynamo_base, dynamo_runtime, and wheel_builder flow so that various pieces are built once and then reused/cached later."
  - "You may want to put a big comment in shared targets (e.g. dynamo_base, wheel_builder, dynamo_runtime, etc), saying that they need to be in-sync between all the Dockerfile.{vllm,trtllm,sglang} files. Otherwise, somebody is going to get lazy, modify only one file, and mess something up. Definitely look into templating."
  - "The tradeoff to optimization is that the stage graph is now pretty hard to follow. I find it really hard to follow this code now, unless I ask AI to give me a dependency/flow chart like the one below. Maybe we could add the dependency/flow chart next to the code, for better understanding. The AI can sync it up pretty easily."
  - "Looking forward to get this in, it will be good to have ..."

8. DOCUMENTATION BUILD AND CI CHECKS
=============================================================================

## 8.1 Sphinx Documentation

### 8.1.1 Overview
- Source: docs/ directory
- Build output: docs/build/html/
- Main script: docs/generate_docs.py

### 8.1.2 Build Documentation
```
cd ~/dynamo
python docs/generate_docs.py
```
Steps: make clean → preprocess_docs() → make html

### 8.1.3 Dependencies
```
pip install sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme myst-parser
```

### 8.1.4 Smart Hyperlink Conversion
docs/generate_docs.py converts links automatically:
- GitHub URLs → relative paths (for .md files in docs/)
  Example: https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/docs/guides/metrics.md → ../../guides/metrics.md
- Relative paths → GitHub URLs (for non-.md or outside docs/)
  Example: ../examples/config.pbtxt → https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/examples/config.pbtxt

### 8.1.5 Adding New Files
1. Place file in appropriate subdirectory (docs/backends/*)
3. Add to docs/hidden_toctree.rst (for backend docs not in main TOC)
   Example: backends/sglang/prometheus.md
4. Use relative paths (script handles conversion)
5. Test: python docs/generate_docs.py

### 8.1.6 Toctree Structure
- docs/index.rst: Main index
- docs/_sections/*.rst: Section indexes
- docs/hidden_toctree.rst: Hidden toctree for files not in main TOC
- Backend docs order: TensorRT-LLM, SGLang, vLLM

### 8.1.7 Build Warnings
Sphinx uses -W flag (warnings = errors)
- Missing toctree entries cause failures
- All .md files must be referenced in a toctree
- Check for: "WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree"
- Invalid JSON in code blocks marked as ```json will cause lexer errors
  - Either fix JSON syntax (remove ellipsis ..., comments, etc.)
  - Or change to ```text if non-valid JSON content is intentional

### 8.1.8 Checking Documentation Build
Test locally before pushing (replicates CI environment):
```
cd /path/to/dynamo/repo
docker build -t docs-builder -f container/Dockerfile.docs .
```
Expected: "build succeeded" with no warnings
If fails: Check for missing images, broken links, invalid JSON in code blocks

### 8.1.9 Exclusions
Files in docs/exclusions.txt are skipped during hyperlink conversion

## 8.2 Pre-Merge CI Checks
Run all the checks that CI runs before merging. These commands replicate the
CI environment locally.

Quick checklist before commit:
1. cargo fmt (in all affected directories)
2. cargo clippy --no-deps --all-targets -- -D warnings
3. cargo test --locked --all-targets
4. pre-commit run --all-files (if Python changes)

### 8.2.1 Rust Format Check
Check code formatting (must pass before commit):

cargo fmt -- --check

Check all directories that CI checks:
(cd . && cargo fmt -- --check)
(cd lib/bindings/python && cargo fmt -- --check)
(cd lib/runtime/examples && cargo fmt -- --check)
(cd launch/dynamo-run && cargo fmt -- --check)

Fix formatting:
cargo fmt

### 8.2.2 Rust Clippy Checks
Find unused imports, warnings, and other issues:

cargo clippy --no-deps --all-targets -- -D warnings

Check all directories that CI checks:
(cd . && cargo clippy --no-deps --all-targets -- -D warnings)
(cd lib/bindings/python && cargo clippy --no-deps --all-targets -- -D warnings)
(cd lib/runtime/examples && cargo clippy --no-deps --all-targets -- -D warnings)
(cd launch/dynamo-run && cargo clippy --no-deps --all-targets -- -D warnings)

Find specific issues:
cargo clippy --no-deps --all-targets -- -D warnings > /tmp/clippy.txt 2>&1
grep -B 5 -A 10 "unused import" /tmp/clippy.txt
grep -E "^(error|warning)" /tmp/clippy.txt

### 8.2.3 Rust Tests
Run all tests (unit, doc, integration):

Compile tests first (separate build from execution):
cargo test --locked --no-run

Run doc tests (CI runs doc generation first):
cargo doc --no-deps && cargo test --locked --doc

Run unit tests (--all-targets doesn't run doc tests):
cargo test --locked --all-targets

NOTE: CI runs tests in these directories: ., lib/bindings/python, lib/runtime/examples, launch/dynamo-run

Backend E2E serve tests (aggregated, single-GPU):

pytest tests/serve/ -k "aggregated and not disagg" -v --tb=short

Note: Avoid using -k "aggregated" alone because it also matches "disaggregated".
Always use the combined filter "aggregated and not disagg" so only aggregated tests run.

### 8.2.4 Pre-commit Hooks
Run all pre-commit hooks (Python linting, formatting, etc.):

pre-commit run --all-files
pre-commit run --files path/to/file.py
pre-commit run ruff --all-files
pre-commit run mypy --all-files

Common hooks: ruff (Python linter), mypy (type checking), trailing-whitespace,
end-of-file-fixer, check-yaml, check-json

### 8.2.5 Copyright Headers
Check copyright headers (requires PowerShell):

pwsh .github/workflows/copyright-check.ps1

Or manually check:
grep -L "SPDX-FileCopyrightText" $(find . -name "*.rs" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.go")

### 8.2.6 Cargo Deny (License Checks)
Check licenses and security advisories:

cargo-deny --version || cargo install cargo-deny@0.16.4
cargo-deny --no-default-features check --hide-inclusion-graph licenses bans --config deny.toml

### 8.2.7 Quick Pre-Commit Checklist
Before committing Rust changes, run:
1. cargo fmt
2. cargo clippy --no-deps --all-targets -- -D warnings
3. cargo test --locked --all-targets
4. pre-commit run --all-files  (if Python changes)

Expected result: All checks pass with no errors
